## Design

#### Colour Scheme

This particular colour scheme was chosen as the colours are calming, earthy, natural and welcoming which feels fitting for a travel planning site. I used the colours throughout the website so that the design remains cohesive.

![Colour Palette](docs/readme-images/colours.png)

#### Imagery

The one image on the site was taken from Pexels and compressed for optimisation. I used CSS rules to style it and make it responsive.

#### Fonts

I chose Poppins and Lato as my fonts. I find Poppins stands out with its modern and fun look, making it great for headlines and key elements. Lato is very readable and works well for body text. Together, they provide both style and clarity for my site.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to my project board:

[Project Board](https://github.com/users/Amelia5p/projects/7/views/1)



## Data Model

This is the data model I designed. It has the Django built-in user model that handles authentication and basic user information. The profile extends the User model with added personal information. Trip is the central entity, which has a one-to-one relationship with Trip Location, Trip Details, Trip Budget and Itinerary, in which the itinerary can have have multiple days.

BUGS= getting 405 error when clicking logout, fixed by changing the url
some users do not have a Profile associated with them- fixed by using django signals to auto make profile when sign up.
couldnt get the country form field to work with google api- reliased i was using the wrong ID.

sign up html getting errors- field help texts weren't being wrapped correctly within the expected HTML elements. fixed by changing {{ form.as_p }} to {{ form.as_div }}
